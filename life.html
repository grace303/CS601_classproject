            <h2>Puppy Dodo</h2>
            <p>I adopted Dodo 3 months ago. She used to be a stray so the shelter described her as a "shy" and "under-socialized" dog. However, she is becoming much more outgoing after coming to our home. She knows commands like sit, down, go, leave it, and she is willing to go into the crate for sleep every night! I'm just so lucky to have her, the beautiful and smart little girl.</p>

                <h2>Acrylic Painting</h2>
                <p>I learned acrylic painting from Youtube videos and it saves me from the boring life of these shelter-at-home days. Painting calms me down and leaves anything bothering out.</p>

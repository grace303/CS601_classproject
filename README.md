# CS601_Assignment1
## Intro
This is a biography website of Yanru (Grace) Zhu that includes a description about me, my work, and my life. 
Welcome!

## How I go beyond
1. 2 more pages are added to show more details about myself.
2. 1 video, 1 embeded youtube video, and 1 audio are added to diversify the types of media, though I need to make the audio being able to automatically play consistently in the whole website in the future.
3. Lots of images that can be turned into a gallery in the future.
4. Two tables are used.


## How to run
Open the CS601_HW1_Zhu folder, click on "index.html" to open it on in your browser, then you can click on the nav bar items to browse around the website.

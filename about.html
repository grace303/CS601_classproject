            <p>Hey, this is Grace! I'm an Email Developer who has been building tons of email templates from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Freemarker/Liquid. I also use Javascript & Python to create applications that can automate email development process during my work.</p>        
            <p>A class called "Web Design and Development" at Boston University COM spurred my interest in this field in 2014 and that's when I started improving my front-end skills. I've got a master's degree in Advertising from BU, but I made a decision to further my study at BU again, in the Computer Science field. That's why I became a part-time student at BU pursuing a master's degree in Software Development last year.
            <p>After work, I love acrytic painting and hiking with my puppy!</p>

            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>Hey, this is Yanru (Grace)! I'm an Email Developer who has been building tons of email templates from
                scratch using HTML, CSS, and Freemarker/Liquid. I also use Javascript & Python to create applications
                that can automate email development process during my work.</p>
            <p>A class called "Web Design and Development" at Boston University COM spurred my interest in this field in
                2014 and that's when I started improving my front-end skills. I've got a master's degree in Advertising
                from BU, but I made a decision to further my study at BU again, in the Computer Science field. That's
                why I became a part-time student at BU pursuing a master's degree in Software Development last year.</p>
            <p>I come from a city called "Chengdu" that is well-known for its spicy Szechuan food and pandas. Currently,
                I'm living in the SF Bay Area of California. After work, I love acrytic painting and hiking with my
                puppy!</p>
